>### This project are DEPRECATED
..and moved to a closed source project.. https://github.com/intrd/bitcoin-tofybot

After losing some money on Bitcoin exchanges, I decided to develop my own Trading bot/helper. This bot acts with pre-defined parameters based on statistics/strategies and not with the emotion of the moment, so it's much easier to perform trading operations.

**HAL10K** is a Bitcoin trading/helper bot written in PHP (open source). It was developed to be used on the API MtGox, but can be easily adapted to other exchanges. Their decisions are based on customizable parameters and trading techniques for market analysis. It also works in semi-automatic mode, in which each loss(stop-loss) asks via Twitter for remote confirmation of a bot operator. Besides the "Live Trading" so it also runs simulations "Backtesting/Paper trading" using "Fake Balance" and historical raw data from **Bitcoincharts.com**. All bot actions(buying/selling) and alerts(high volume detected) are notified via Twitter. Log results is accompanied by HTTP Control panel where the bot displays its own performance chart panel.

**HAL10K** was developed "from scratch", without taking basis of existing algorithms/trading techniques. This project is a learning exercise on Trading/Economics for me, when started this project my experience was limited in programming and Bitcoin. Yes, I'm already getting real profits with this trading bot, and the idea of ​​Open Source assumed that sharing experiences, together we can greatly improve the algorithm and achieve even greater profits.

>Please, do not go to the Live trading before mastering the paper trading.
>The author of this project and its contributors are not responsible for any losses.
